            <p class="info1">
                My name is Diego Castillo Samperio, I am a currently a senior studying Computer Science at McKendree University.
                <br /> I was born on April 18 in Guadalajara, Jalisco in Mexico. I have always played sports,
                <br /> I started doing karate when I was 5 years old and got to be a black belt at the age of 10, however at 11 years old I decided to
                <br /> leave karate and start my tennis career. When I started playing tennis, I knew it was going to be an important part in my life,
                <br /> I continued playing tennis all the way trough high school, I was part of one of the best high school/college team in the country,
                <br /> however I always wanted to play college tennis in the United States.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I turned 17, I had to start looking for colleges in the United States, I had Division 1 offers, as well as Division 2 offers
                <br /> to play tennis and get my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, ultimately I decided to commit to McKendree University,
                <br /> where I received academic and athletic scholarship to play in the Men's Tennis Team.

                Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey campus Guadalajara: 2017-2020
                <br />
                <br />
                The Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey is one of the best high schools in Mexico, however I was accepted.
                <br /> At the begining it was difficult, since I would leave my house at 6:30 am to have 8 hours of class and right after 1 hour
                <br /> of weights and 3 of tennis, leaving campus at 7:00 pm to go back and do 1 more hour of Crossfit and do homework afterwards,
                <br /> doing this 5 days a week was very hard, however I managed to do a good job.
                <br />
                <br />
                Being at the Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey helped me develop my academic, sports and social skills,
                <br /> I got a better interest towards math and programming which ultimately led to studying Computer Science, 
                <br /> enhancing my Tennis skills and giving me friends and connections that are still meaningful after all these years.

            <p class="info3">
                McKendree University is a private university located in Lebanon, a town 15 minutes away from St. Louis, MO.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have a lot of good memories frombeing at McKendree University, being in classes with my teammates after having 5:30 am practice,
                <br /> travelling with the team, and just living the college experience with a great group of people. From an academic standpoint, 
                <br /> I have been having a great performance during my time at McKendree University, having a cummulative GPA of 3.4, while being 
                <br /> in the National Honor Society of Sigma Zeta, the McKendree University Men’s Tennis team, the McKendree University Robotics Team,
                <br /> the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM), being the Vice President at the Lyn Huxford Center for Community Service 
                <br /> and a McKendree University UNI-101 peer mentor. 
                <br /> I have learned a lot about object-oriented programming, especially C++, which is today one of my favorite languages.
